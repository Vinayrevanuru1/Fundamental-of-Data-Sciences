# Fundamental-of-Data-Sciences

This Repository contains content and  assignments with my solutions of the course taught by Prof. David Hillegass during Fall 2022 at Georgia State University.
He really is making us to sit for long hours  to work on the course , 
all these files are just for references , if someone who has dug deep enough has found this.


If you need slides taught by professor  Hillegass, Please go to  www.uscampgrounds.info/slides  (yes , Prof. is cool enough to include his dad's website in his work flow)
